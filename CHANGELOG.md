## [0.5.1] - 2023-11-02

### Added

- The [`prost`](https://crates.io/crates/prost) and [`prost-reflect`](https://crates.io/crates/prost-reflect) dependencies are now re-exported at the crate root, for easier use in build scripts.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-09-01

## [0.4.1] - 2023-06-25

## Fixed

- Fixed a panic while parsing an invalid file like `{ $`.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-06-18

## Changed

- **Breaking**: `Compiler::files` is now returns an iterator of `FileMetadata` instances, to avoid some clones while compiling a file.

## [0.3.5] - 2023-06-05

### Changed

- The error when reading invalid UTF-8 is now classified as a parse error, not an IO error.

## [0.3.4] - 2023-06-05

### Added

- Added new methods to get error details: `Error::is_parse`, `Error::is_io` and `Error::file`.

## [0.3.3] - 2023-04-27

### Changed

- Updated logos dependency to [0.13.0](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos/releases/tag/v0.13).
- Reduce minimum supported rust version to 1.60.0 to match [prost-reflect](https://crates.io/crates/prost-reflect).

## [0.3.1] - 2023-04-10

### Added

- Added the [`Compiler::files`](https://docs.rs/protox/latest/protox/struct.Compiler.html#method.files) method to get all imported files. This may be used to emit [`rerun-if-changed`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#rerun-if-changed) directives in a build script.

### Changed

- The `Debug` representation of `Error` is now more concise and readable, to support usage with `unwrap` in build scripts.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-04-04

### Added

- Added the [`Compiler::descriptor_pool`](https://docs.rs/protox/latest/protox/struct.Compiler.html#method.descriptor_pool) method to get the descriptor pool containing all referenced files.

### Changed

- Updated `prost-reflect` dependency to [0.11.0](https://crates.io/crates/prost-reflect/0.11.0).
- Renamed `File::to_file_descriptor_proto` to `File::file_descriptor_proto` and changed it to return a reference instead of cloning.

## [0.2.2] - 2023-02-19

### Changed

- `protox_parse::parse` will no longer automatically populate the `json_name` field of fields. This behaviour has moved to `prost-reflect` (see (#27)[https://github.com/andrewhickman/prost-reflect/pull/27]), so the behaviour of `protox::compile` is unchanged.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-01-07

### Fixed

- Fixed decoding of `DescriptorSetFileResolver`.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-01-04

### Changed

- **Breaking**: The `parse()` function now takes an additional argument for the file name.
- **Breaking**: `Compiler::add_file` is renamed to `Compiler::open_file`.

### Fixed

- Fixed name resolution in nested messages
- Fixed source info for oneofs not including comments
- Enums now respect the allow_alias option
- Extension options are now supported
- More validation checks have been added (some still remain, see [#5](https://github.com/andrewhickman/prost-reflect/issues/5))

## [0.1.0] - 2022-07-25

### Added

- Initial release, implementing most of the functionality of protoc in rust. The main unimplemented features are:
  - Setting extension options in .proto source files is not supported
  - Some validation checks are missing
